# Libaacs

**libaacs** is a research project for a cross-platform open-source implementation of the AACS specification.


## Goals and features

This research project provides, through an open-source library, a way to understand how the AACS works.

This research project is mainly developed by an international team of developers from **Doom9**.

Currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS X. The main dependency is libgcrypt for all cryptographic functions.

# Disclaimer

This library is written for the purpose of playing Blu-ray movies.

It is intended for software that want to support Blu-ray playback (such as VLC and
MPlayer). We, the authors of this library, do not condone nor endorse piracy.

This library is simply a tool for playback of Blu-ray movies. Like any tool, the
use of this tool can also be abused. There are already numerous laws in
different countries and juridictions all over the world that protect copyrighted
material, such as Blu-ray movies.

With that said, it would have been impossible for us to distribute this library
with terms such as "you cannot use this library for piracy", because this would
violate the Open Source Definition and the LGPL license.
Instead, we present to everyone this disclaimer.

As a reminder, here is also the disclaimer found at the beginning of any movie
in relation to copyrights.

## ATTENTION

International agreement and national laws protect copyrighted motion pictures,
videotapes, and sound recordings.

UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION, EXHIBITION OR DISTRIBUTION OF COPYRIGHTED MOTION
PICTURES CAN RESULT IN SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER THE LAWS OF
YOUR COUNTRY.

The International Criminal Police Organization - INTERPOL, has expressed its
concern about motion picture and sound recording piracy to all of its member
national police forces. (Resolution adopted at INTERPOL General Assembly,
Stockholm, Sweden, September 8, 1977.)
